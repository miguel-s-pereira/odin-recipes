    <h1>Shrimp Pasta Salad with a Creamy Lemon Dressing
    </h1>
    <img src="../images/shrimp.jpeg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Very light flavor and low in calories. Originally meant to be a side dish I made some healthy substitutions and added shrimp. I usually serve with asparagus, the entire family loves it.
